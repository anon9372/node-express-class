1) Installing globally = npm i packageName -globally
2) As a dependency: npm i packageName
3) As a devDependency: npm i packageName -D


Event Loop -> Event loop allows nodejs to perform non-blocking I/O operations, despite JS being a single threaded language.

Global Variables:
// GLOBALS  - NO WINDOW !!!!

// __dirname  - path to current directory
// __filename - file name
// require    - function to use modules (CommonJS)
// module     - info about current module (file)
// process    - info about env where the program is being executed

======================================================================================================

NPM
// npm - global command, comes with node
// npm --version
// local dependency - use it only in this particular project
// npm 1 <packageName>
// install onnly for devDep:  npm i lodash --save-dev

// package.json - manifest file (stores important info about project/package)
// manual approach (create package.json in the root, create properties etc)
// npm init (step by step, press enter to skip)
// npm init -y (everything default)


const = require('lodash')
const items = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]]
const newItems = _.flattenDeep(items)
console.log(newItems)

// sharing code -> .gitignore 
// uninstall npm 

// global dependency - use it in any project
// npm install -g <packageName>
// sudo install -g <packageName> (mac)

Async pattern - Blocking Code
Async Pattern - Setup Promises 
Async Pattern - Refactor to Async
Event emitter - What is Event emitter?  -- > Event emitter is a module that helps in communicating with node objects, just like events that we trigger in a browser environment.

Steps to create a server in NodeJS using HTTP Module:
1) Import or require HTTP Module
2) Create a server and within that create routes.
3) Start the server

Event emitter - Code.


====================================================
TCP AND UDP Protocols

Streams: 

1) Writeable -> Used to write data sequentially
2) Readable -> Used to read data sequentially
3) Duplex -> Used to do both of the above
4) Transform -> Modifying data when reading or writing

Stream breaks a file into pieces of smaller files each with default size of around 65kb


EVENT EMITTERS:
In Node.js, an event emitter is a core module that allows developers to create and handle custom events. It is a fundamental building block for developing event-driven applications in Node.js.

The event emitter module provides a class called EventEmitter that can be extended to create custom event emitters. The EventEmitter class provides several methods, including on(), emit(), and once(), that allow you to register listeners for events and trigger events

Event emitters are used extensively in Node.js applications, including web servers, database connections, and other types of I/O operations. They allow developers to write asynchronous, non-blocking code that can handle multiple events at the same time.





// ================ EXPRESS ====================== //


API vs SSR 

API => Application Programming Interface
        - JSON
        - Send the 'Data'
        - res.json()

SSR => Server Side Rendering
        - Template
        - Send the 'Template'
        - res.render()


Params and Queries 

Params: Params means parameters
        Used to dynamically access items through APIs



================================ MIDDLEWARE ================================
app.get('/',middleware, (req, res) => {
=== some actions with req and res ===

next()
})


Middleware takes in the req and performes certain actions on it and the gives out the response.

app.use => Mounts the specified middleware function or functions at the specified path: the middleware function is executed when the base of the requested path matches path.


Middleware:
 1. Manually Created ---- Done
 2. Express ---- Done
 3. Third Party middleware

JWT -> JSON WEB TOKEN


Express Router:

The express.Router() function is used to create a new router object. This function is used when you want to create a new router object in your program to handle requests. Multiple requests can be easily differentiated with the help of the Router() function in Express.js.


DRY -> Don't Repeat Yourself

============================= Mongo and Mongoose =============================

There are 2 types of database: SQL and NoSQL
1) Structured Query language -> PostgreSQL 
        Rigid

2) No SQL --> Non Relations -> Mongodb or dynomodb 

        Store the data in the following way:
         1) Column oriented
         2) Key-value stores
         3) Document Stores 
         4) Graphs Database

        Dynamic

IBM Difference between SQL and NoSQL: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/sql-vs-nosql#:~:text=These%20databases%20are%20commonly%20called,row%20transactions%20or%20unstructured%20data.



Setting up a Mongo DB server: 

1) Create a cloud db with Mongo Atlas
2) Connecting the db using nodejs and Mongoose middleware 
3) Create Models (schema) from our data using Mongoose 
4) Expose the apis created to perform our db operations.
